<p>Itâ€™s as if the past and the present coexist in a fragile equilibrium, where memories of bygone days linger in the corners of our minds like fading photographs. This city, with its palm-lined boulevards and hidden pockets of glamour, has a way of blurring the lines between what once was and what is now. As I navigate these sun-bleached streets, I am reminded that in this sprawling metropolis, the ghosts of our past selves are never truly laid to rest, but instead, they haunt us like the distant echoes of a forgotten melody.</p>
